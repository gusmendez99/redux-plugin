# Redux Plugin
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) suggested sub-architecture for 'plugin' [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components.

## Installation
```
npm install redux-plugin --save
```

## Motivation
Several times you will be writing reducers that manages multiple homogeneous state trees. For example, I wrote a PopOver component whose state is managed by redux. This component and it's reducer handles the basic tasks:
- Open / Close specific popover
- Open / Close all popovers
- Open / Close specific group of popovers
- Render another component as the popover content

Each instance of the PopOver component has it's own redux state sub-tree, coordinated by the `popover` reducer. The popover reducer use reducer composition to handle each popover individual state.

`redux-plugin` helps you defining plugin components and composed plugin reducers.

## Key concepts
`redux-plugin` supposes a special mindset about components: the *plugin components*. I encourage reading this section before jumping to the library, in order to see if this specific mindset fits your project.

### Plugin reducer
The plugin reducer manages multiple instances of each plugin element state. For example, the `popover` plugin reducer manages the following part of the state:

```Javascript
{
  ...,
  popover: {
    navNotifications: {
      isOpen: false,
      groups: ['popovers', 'tour-1'],
      configuration: {
        vertical: "below",
        horizontal: "center",
        withTip: true
      }
    },
    submitTooltip: {
      isOpen: true,
      groups: ['tooltips', 'tour-2'],
      configuration: {
        vertical: "above",
        horizontal: "center",
        withTip: true
      }
    },
    formError: {
      isOpen: false,
      groups: ['errors'],
      configuration: {
        vertical: "above",
        horizontal: "right",
        offset: 25,
        withTip: true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The creation of a plugin reducer happens with a higher order reducer provided by `redux-plugin`:

```Javascript

import { pluginReducer as plugin } from 'redux-plugin';

const popover = plugin({
  name: 'popover',
  prefix: '@@redux-popover',
  reducer: popoverElement
});

```

If the plugin reducer receives a global action (ie. paylod has not the `id` key), it iterates and passes down the action to all the plugin element reducers.

### Plugin element reducer
It's a plain old reducer that manages the state for each plugin element (you just have to think of the state transitions of one popover!).

```Javascript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

const popoverElement = combineReducers({
  isOpen,
  groups,
  configuration
});
```

### Plugin element
Each instance of a plugin. It's state is managed by the element reducer, but proxied by the plugin reducer.

### Plugin element component
Dummy (presentational) component that takes simple props and renders the a plugin element instance (you just have to think the rendering of one popover!).

### Plugin component
Smart (connected) component that takes an `id` as prop, fetches the specific plugin element state and passes it down to the plugin element component. This component is generated by a higher order component.

```Javascript
import { pluginComponent as plugin } from 'redux-plugin';
import { register } from './actions';
import Popover from './components/popover';

export const ReduxPopover = plugin({
  defaultStateKey: 'popover',
  registerPluginElement: register
})(Popover);

```

### Registration action creator
Simple action creator that handles the registration of a new instance of a plugin (plugin element). The signature of this action creator should be `(id, initialState)`, where id is the plugin element id, and initialState is the first state of this plugin element.

```Javascript
export const register = (id, { isOpen = false, groups = [], configuration }) => ({
  type: types.POPOVER_REGISTERED,
  payload: { id, isOpen, groups, configuration }
});
```

### Plugin
A plugin is the combination of a plugin reducer and a plugin component.

## Use
Read the descriptions above to understand how to create the Popover component, then the following code should make sense:

```Javascript
import { Popover } from './components/popover';

const PopoverContent = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <p>This is the popover content!</p>
  </div>
);

const View = () => (
  <Popover
    id='buttonPopover'
    initialState={ { isOpen: true } }
    content={ PopoverContent }>
    <button>Open!</button>
  </Popover>
);
```
